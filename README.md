Portfolio v2

Built a new and updated portfolio website to give a more current display of my skillset and new projects. It is built with react and styled with tailwind. I opted to use react as I hadn't used it much in the past few months due to developing primarily server side, so I wanted to refresh my skills with it. In addition, I'm trying to build fluency with tailwind due to it speeding up one of the most time consuming aspects of my development(styling). Ensuring the proper responsiveness with tailwind was probably the most difficult part of this as I used the default width only breakpoints. This was very apparent to me once I flipped devices into landscape mode. So I opted to remove snap which was originally present and stay with smooth scroll features only.
